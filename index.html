    Giving your own contact information to each one you meet isn’t a smart idea. Disposable number adds an additional layer of confidentiality once communication is needed however users don’t want to show personal or private numbers. Putting up things for sale on stores online using temporary numbers is indeed a smart way to talk to a stranger without revealing your personal number.
